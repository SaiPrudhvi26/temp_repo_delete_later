        dynamically typed language
        doesn't have to mention the type of the data we are storing in a variable

    iterable: iterable is any object that can looped upon
    list:
        - used to store multiple values
        - can be of different data types
        - mutable (once created, can be altered)
        - duplicates are allowed
        - created using [] or list function
        ex:
            a = [1, 2, 1]

        methods:
            append -> adds item to the end of the list
            insert -> adds to the given index and moves all other items to the right
            pop -> by default pops the last item, if index is provided, pops item from given index
            remove -> accepts value of the item to be removed form the list
            
    
    tuple:
        - used to store multiple values
        - can be of different data types
        - immutable (once created, can not be altered)
        - duplicates are allowed
        - created using () or tuple function
        ex: 
            t = (1, 2, 1)
    set: 
        - used to store multiple values
        - can be a different data types
        - mutable
        - duplicates are not allowed
        - creted using {} or set function
        ex: 
            s = {1, 2, 1} # but stores as {1, 2}

    dictionary:
        - used to store key, value pairs
        - key, value pairs are separated by comma (,)
        - keys should be unique
        - mutable
        - created using {} or dict function
        - dict.keys() -> returns all the keys
        - dict.vlaues() -> returns all the vlaues


git: 
    1. Creating a repo: 
        you can either 
            - create a new repo. and start coding or 
            - convert an existing project folder into a repo or
            - clone someone else's repo.

    2. Adding 2nd point
